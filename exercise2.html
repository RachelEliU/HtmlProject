        1. HTML allows you to browse the internet with ease.
    </h2>
    <p style="font-family:arial;">
        All you need to do is click on a link to travel on the internet, or enter the URL in the address bar.

        Hypertext is what makes travel between the internet possible, especially if you haven’t memorized all the URLs on the whole internet. It’s essential to guide users around your website and act as a door to know that different rooms exist and can travel between them.

        Without hypertext, how can you tell if there are other web pages to visit at all?

        2. HTML allows you to create web documents.
    </h2>
    <p style="font-family:cursive;">
        A web document is a web page. All web pages are possible because you can create the content you want the user to see and then wrap them up in snug code that tells the computer how to format the whole thing. That lets your browser know what text the heading is, what text the body is, and what text the metadata is. It’s labeled, so the computer understands what to do with the content that you give it.

    <h2>
        3. HTML comes with cutting-edge features.
    </h2>
    <p style="font-family:fantasy;">
        HTML supports Polyfill, which is a piece of code that lets you use different technology natively. That means that you can mimic a future API and give fallback functionality to older browsers. You can use polyfill libraries according to your needs and do things no one has ever done before.

    <h2>
        4. HTML supports data entry.
    </h2>
    <p style="font-family:monospace;">
        You have the standard APIs needed to support any data entry work. All developers need to do is add tags that indicate the required fields, such as text and data formats. You can even support on-screen keyboards and validation, which allows the user to have a smooth and comfortable experience.
